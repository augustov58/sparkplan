## Guiding Principle

Go where the customers already are, answer the question they're already asking, and show them the output. Don't generate demand — capture it.

---

## Tier 1: Do This Week (Free, High Intent)

### 1. Mike Holt Forums — Answer real questions with the tool

**Why #1:** Customers are literally there right now asking "how do I calculate NEC 220.84 for a 30-unit building with EV chargers?" and getting wrong answers like "there is no feasible answer."

**Tactical approach:**
- Don't post "check out my tool" — that gets you banned
- Find active threads about MF EV calculations, NEC 220.84 confusion, or service upgrade sizing
- Post a **detailed, helpful answer** showing the math: demand factors, measurement path, what the numbers come out to
- Include a screenshot of the PDF output as "here's how I laid this out for a permit package"
- Put your link in your forum signature, not in the post body

**Search terms on the forum:**
- "220.84" + "EV"
- "multi-family" + "charger"
- "service upgrade" + "multi unit"
- "demand factor" + "dwelling"

### 2. Reddit r/electricians — Same approach, different audience

- 400K+ members
- Search for "multi-family" "EV charger" "load calculation" "service upgrade" posts
- Same helpful-answer strategy — lead with value, not promotion
- Also check r/evcharging and r/solar for crossover posts

### 3. Record one demo video — Screen recording, 5-10 minutes

Walk through the 35-unit building scenario:
- Calculation path shows 80A available (1-2 chargers — "impossible")
- Measurement path shows 450A available (9-12 chargers — "feasible")
- Show the PDF output

Post to YouTube with titles like:
- "NEC 220.84 Multi-Family EV Load Calculation — Step by Step"
- "Multi-Family EV Charging: The Calculation Most Electricians Get Wrong"

This becomes evergreen search traffic for people Googling these exact terms. Don't overthink production quality — screen recording with narration is fine.

## Tier 2: Weeks 2-4 (Free, Direct Outreach)

### 4. DM 10 contractors from forum threads

Find people who posted about MF EV problems in the last 6 months. Message them:

> "Hey, I saw your post about the 24-unit building EV project. I built a tool that handles NEC 220.84 with demand factors — would you want me to run your numbers? Free, just want feedback."

**What you're testing:**
- Do they actually engage? (pain is real)
- Do they use the output? (product fits workflow)
- Do they ask "how do I get more?" (willingness to pay)

**Success criteria:**
- 5+ out of 10 engage → pain confirmed
- 3+ ask about ongoing access → conversion potential
- 1+ uses output for a real permit → product-market fit signal

### 5. LinkedIn — California EV contractors

Search: "EV installation" + "California" + "owner" or "operations manager"

Same offer — free calculation in exchange for feedback.

**Why California first:**
- Strictest mandates (100% MF parking EV-ready by 2026)
- Highest construction volume (27% of national MF completions)
- Regulatory urgency removes "do I really need this?" objection

## Tier 3: Month 2 (Small Budget)

### 6. Google Ads — Long-tail NEC keywords

| Keyword | Competition | Intent | Est. CPC |
|---------|------------|--------|----------|
| "NEC 220.84 calculator" | Very low | Very high | $2-5 |
| "multi-family EV load calculation" | Very low | Very high | $2-5 |
| "EV charging permit calculator" | Low | High | $3-5 |
| "multi-family dwelling demand factor" | Very low | Very high | $2-3 |
| "service upgrade calculator EV" | Low | High | $3-5 |

**Budget:** $200-500/mo to start. Almost no competition because nobody else has a product for this.

### 7. YouTube tutorial series

| Video | Target Search |
|-------|--------------|
| "How to Calculate NEC 220.84 Demand Factors" | Electricians learning MF calcs |
| "NEC 220.87: The Measurement Path Most Electricians Don't Know About" | Service upgrade questions |
| "Multi-Family EV Charging: How to Size the Service" | EV + MF intersection |
| "EV Charger Permit Package: What Inspectors Want to See" | Permit preparation |

These rank for years. Every contractor who Googles these topics finds you.

## What NOT to Spend Time On Yet

| Channel | Why Not |
|---------|---------|
| Social media (Instagram, TikTok, Facebook ads) | Wrong audience, low intent |
| Trade shows | Too expensive and slow for validation phase |
| Email campaigns | No list yet |
| SEO blog posts | Takes 6+ months to rank; YouTube is faster |
| Partnerships (ChargePoint, Tesla networks) | Premature without proven traction |
| Referral programs | Need users first |
| PR / press coverage | Nobody covers pre-revenue niche tools |

---

- If 1-3 paying customers → Iterate on positioning and outreach
- If 0 paying customers → Reassess niche per Validation Analysis alternative niches

**After Month 3:**
- Best-performing channel gets 80% of effort
- Cut channels with zero conversion
