## The 5 Steps for Success (Foundation)

Before diving into tactics, David emphasizes these foundational principles:

### 1. Distribution is Just as Important as Product (00:23)
> "A lot of you only build the product, but you never think about the distribution. But having a unique distribution mechanism sometimes will make you more money than having a unique product."

### 2. Have a Clear Target Avatar (00:37)
- **Single ICP** (Ideal Customer Profile)
- **Single niche**
- **Specific person**
- Common mistake: "My product is going to be useful for everybody" - this is a delusion
- Trying to sell to everybody is one of the biggest mistakes in the beginning

### 3. Solve a Painful Problem (01:04)
- **Build painkillers, not vitamins**
- Something "nice to have" won't sell
- Solve an "urgent and intense pain that people are willing to pay a lot of money for"
- This makes getting customers much easier

### 4. Spend at Least 45 Minutes Per Day on Distribution (01:24)
- **Time block this as the FIRST 45-minute block of your day**
- Don't delay to the end
- Deep work dedicated solely to promotion/distribution/marketing
- Later expands this to 50% of total work time

### 5. Start Now (01:48)
- The longer you delay, the higher the risk you're building something nobody wants
- "You spend 6 months, 12 months, 18 months building a product that the market simply doesn't want"
- Try to get paying customers as soon as possible
- If you can't get them, maybe you should be building something else

---

## Method 1: Organic Marketing (02:34)

### Key Principles

#### Long-Form Content > Short-Form (02:43)
- 10, 20, 30-minute videos build WAY more trust than 30-second TikToks
- "I would much rather have a YouTube channel with 1,000 subscribers than a TikTok channel with 100,000"

#### Nobody is Good on Camera at First (03:11)
- This is one of the biggest excuses
- "When you start, you're going to suck. You're going to be awkward."
- This is part of the process - stop using it as an excuse

#### You Don't Need Millions of Views (04:05)
**Case Study - Patrick**: Made $8,000 with just 30 subscribers
- Made a single video about AI in manufacturing
- Got around 200 views
- Someone running a $50 million manufacturing business saw it
- Paid him $8,000 for consulting
- **Power of going niche**: 50 views from your exact target avatar > 50,000 views from random people

#### Upload Before Launch (05:07)
- "So many people delay marketing or promotion after the product is ready. The truth is it's never going to be ready."
- Friends who are "always two weeks away from launching"
- Two tactics for pre-launch:
  1. **Waitlist**: Collect emails, names, maybe phone numbers before launching
  2. **Pre-sale**: Create a better offer before launch (e.g., $99/month instead of planned $200/month)

#### Set a Hard Limit, Not a Schedule (06:21)
- Traditional: 1 video per week (makes you lazy, delay to last day)
- **Hard Limit**: Maximum number of days between videos
- Recommended: 2, 3, or 4 days max
- "You don't need more than 5 days to make a video. You're not Mr. Beast."
- Allows uploading more frequently when inspired

#### Build the Product to Market Itself (07:39)
- Fancy, shareable UI
- Spotify Wrapped style personalized summaries
- Small watermark in corner of UI
- Make it more shareable, more marketable

#### Every Update = New Video Idea (08:18)
- Get "paid twice for the same amount of work"
- Product improvement + content to advertise = flywheel effect

#### Building a Priceless Skill (08:57)
Being good on camera helps with:
- Creating great pitches to investors
- Paid ads (Facebook, Google, Twitter, LinkedIn)
- Sales calls (more confident, better spoken)
- Recruiting better talent

#### Brainstorm 5 Video Ideas Every Day (10:02)
- Separate brainstorming from selecting
- When brainstorming, anything goes - don't qualify
- Most will be bad, some neutral, some good
- **Result**: 150 video ideas per month
- Never run out of content ideas
- Higher likelihood of choosing a great idea

#### Experiment Then Triple Down (11:08)
- If a certain type of video isn't working, try a different type
- Once you find something that works, **make a lot more of it**
- 80% proven format, 20% experimental
- "Once you find something that works, you need to triple down. Lock in, work harder than ever."

---

## Method 2: Cold DMs (12:25)

### Why Cold DMs Work at the Beginning (12:38)
- "DMing people is not scalable, and that's actually good"
- At the beginning: You have nothing to lose, plenty of time, no paying customers
- Allows personalized outreach (mention their newborn, vacation, etc.)
- Not for building a billion-dollar company, but for getting first users

### Time Allocation (13:51)
- **50% of work time on distribution** (these 4 methods)
- **50% on building the product**
- **0% on everything else** (conferences, events = distraction)
- If working 4 hours/day: 2 hours marketing, 2 hours building

### Finding the Right People (14:51)
- Find people talking about the problem your product solves
- **At first, offer to solve the problem for FREE**
  - Get free users
  - See how they use your product
  - Get priceless feedback
  - Ask for testimonials
  - Free customers can become paying customers

### Pitch Before You Build (15:35)
- Validate whether your target avatar has willingness to pay
- If they say "it's not really that big of an issue for my company" - don't continue building
- Strong responses: "Oh my god, yes, this problem is so bad in my business. It's costing me thousands every month."

### David's Instagram DM Strategy (17:17) - What He Did at Age 16

1. **Find the largest accounts in your niche**
2. **Go to their latest post**
3. **Click on the likes** and follow people who liked the post
4. **10-15% will follow you back** (curious who you are)
5. **DM the people who follow you back**
6. **Use a casual opener** (must be a question)
   - "How's your Tuesday?"
   - "Did you see the football match this week?"
7. **Once they're responding, begin selling**
8. **Use AI (Claude Opus 4.5) to design your sales script**
   - Provide: your product, problem it solves, target avatar
   - Update script when you encounter new objections

### Target Competitor's Unhappy Customers (20:00)
- Find people who posted 1-star or 2-star reviews of competitors
- DM them with a **special offer**
- Credit their competitor spend as a discount on your product
- Example: They spent $200 with competitor, your annual plan is $500, offer it for $300

### Pricing Strategy (20:35)
- Most founders charge too little ($10-30/month)
- Create **annual plans** and **2-year plans**
- Add upsells, cross-promotions, downsells
- Build high LTV (Lifetime Value)

### Partner with a Friend (22:07)
- **The biggest issue with cold DMs is trust**
- Work with a friend in the same space
- You promote your friend's services, they promote yours
- Third-party recommendation is more powerful than self-promotion
- This is why word of mouth is the most powerful marketing method

### Offer Personalized Onboarding (23:17)
- Include onboarding with annual/2-year plans
- Become their "tech guy"
- 60-minute initial onboarding call
- 30-minute weekly follow-up calls
- Makes offer much higher perceived value with relatively low extra work

### Cold DMs for First 10 Paying Customers (24:30)
- Not scalable to 10,000 customers
- Goal: Get first 10 paying customers
- From those 10: Get testimonials and reviews (video, screenshots, written quotes)
- "Hey, look at all these people. They have the same problem. They look like you. I sold it to them. Look at these five star reviews."

---

## Community Engagement (25:22)

### Where to Find Communities
- Discord servers
- Facebook groups
- Skool.com (free communities)
- Subreddits
- Telegram groups

### The 9:1 Ratio (26:10)
- **9 value posts : 1 selling post**
- 90-95% pure value, helping others, building your name
- 5-10% soft selling
- Read community guidelines to not get banned
- Become one of the most active and helpful contributors

### DM in Communities (27:46)
When people describe a problem your software solves:
- Cold DM them personally, OR
- Mention casually in comments: "I developed something that solves that. Feel free to check it out."
- When people DM you for advice, you can do more aggressive selling (admin won't see)

---

## Method 3: Micro Influencers (28:08)

### Who Are Micro Influencers?
- **500 to 20,000 followers in your niche**

### Why Micro Influencers? (28:17)
- **They have no clue how to price their promotions**
- Many will work for FREE
- Creates insane arbitrage opportunity
- Not competing with billionaire companies (McDonald's, Coca-Cola)
- "You're usually competing with nobody because they have no other options"

### David's Vectal Example (29:04)
Found a YouTuber who:
- Had less subscribers than David
- But was getting MORE views per video
- Was charging **7x less** for sponsored videos
- Why? Less experience with brand deals

### Go Niche (30:58)
> "If you're like, 'Oh, no, David. The software I'm building could really be useful for everybody. I'm building a general AI agent that will save you 10 hours per week and anybody can use it.' Well, tough luck. You're going to have a very hard time marketing."

### Free Promotion Strategy (31:58)
For influencers with 500-5,000 followers who don't want payment:
1. Offer **30-50% affiliate revenue share**
2. Give **lifetime access** to your software
3. Personally onboard them

Benefits:
- They happily promote for you
- They start making money
- You keep 50%+ and outsource marketing

### Paid Strategy: Bulk Deals (33:22)
**The secret to micro influencer deals**

- Standard: $500/video x 4 videos = $2,000
- **Bulk deal**: Offer 50-60% discount for 4-5 video package
- **Result**: Pay $800-1,000 instead of $2,000

Why it works:
- Micro influencers value **stability and predictable income**
- They're not entrepreneurs with risk-taking mindset
- Many have full-time jobs, employee mindset
- Multiple videos = lower risk of all flopping

### Additional Benefits (34:58)
- These people are your **perfect testers**
- They'll spot bugs, suggest features
- Free QA testing + promotion

### Work with 5-10 Micro Influencers (35:29)
- These people usually aren't consistent
- Some will stop posting, quit, switch formats
- Working with 5-10 protects against randomness
- 2-3 out of 10 will be competent and grow

### Maximize Effectiveness (36:27)
- Put great testimonials at **top of landing page**
- Write the script FOR them
- Provide video ideas
- Make it as easy as possible for them to promote your product
- "Do some work for them for free"

### Hold Them Accountable (38:58)
- Check in daily (politely)
- "Hey, Stephen, how's it going? You planning on making a video today?"
- Be their accountability buddy
- Set standards: "You mentioned posting 3x/week, it's Wednesday and no first video yet"

### Path to Macro Influencers (39:51)
Once you master micro influencers:
- Same skills transfer to macro influencers (50k+)
- More expensive but easier and more scalable

---

## Method 4: SEO (Search Engine Optimization) (40:30)

### AI-Powered SEO (40:36)
- Use AI to help write SEO articles
- **Don't use GPT** - people are used to that format
- **Use Claude or Gemini** - more creative, unique writing style
- Ideally Opus 4.5 or best Claude model

### Target Problem Keywords, Not Product Keywords (41:45)
- Bad: "best editing software"
- Good: "how to remove background from video"
- Target problems relevant to your software
- Use AI to brainstorm relevant problems

### One Article Per Problem (42:18)
- Write an article for each problem
- Article 1 = Problem 1
- Article 2 = Problem 2
- etc.

### Human + AI Writing (42:38)
- Don't have 100% AI-written content
- Write at least 50-80% of words yourself
- Makes it more human and authentic

### Separate Landing Pages (43:01)
- Each problem = separate landing page
- Hyperspecific copywriting for each problem
- Bonus: Find which problem converts best, double down on that

### Comparison Pages (44:01)
- "Adobe Premiere vs DaVinci vs CapCut vs YOUR SOFTWARE"
- Three established names + your name
- People get curious about the unknown software
- Some become customers

### YouTube SEO (45:53)
- Not everything should be optimized for virality
- Some content should target search:
  - "How to use XYZ"
  - "Which software is best for Y problem"
- Combines with Method 1 (Organic Marketing)

### SEO Compounds Over Time (46:22)
- More articles = more traffic
- Builds an asset that brings users by itself
- More scalable than cold DMs
- Takes time to get started (long-term strategy)

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

1. **Only building, never distributing** - Spending 100% of time on product, 0% on marketing
2. **Targeting everybody** - "My product is useful for everyone" delusion
3. **Building vitamins, not painkillers** - Nice-to-have vs. must-have
4. **Waiting until product is "ready"** - It's never ready; start marketing now
5. **Making only short-form content** - Long-form builds more trust
6. **Needing millions of views** - 50 niche views > 50,000 random views
7. **Not repeating what works** - Triple down on successful formats
8. **Charging too little** - $10-30/month is not enough; create annual plans
9. **Self-promoting instead of friend-recommending** - Third-party endorsement is more powerful
10. **Expecting micro influencers to be consistent** - Work with 5-10 to hedge
11. **Using GPT for SEO content** - Use Claude for more unique writing
12. **Targeting product keywords** - Target problem keywords instead
13. **Going to conferences and events** - 0% of time on this in the beginning
