## 9. NEC Code Changes Affecting EV

### NEC 2023 Changes (Article 625)

**Branch Circuit Requirements (625.40):**
- Individual branch circuit required only for EVSE outlets >16A or >120V (relaxed)
- Exception: Branch circuits can feed multiple EVSEs per 625.42(A) or (B)

**Load Management (625.42):**
- Revised for EVSE with Energy Management Systems (EMS)
- Where EMS per 750.30 provides load management, max load = max permitted by EMS
- Allows multiple chargers on single circuit if controlled by EMS

**Safety (625.54):**
- GFCI protection required for every charging system
- EVSE >60A or >150V needs readily accessible disconnect with lockout

### NEC 2026 Changes

**Critical shifts:**
- Article 220 moved to Article 120 (renumbered)
- New 120.82(D): "EVSE load calculated at 100% per 120.57" — no demand factors for dwelling unit optional method
- Addresses under-calculation concerns from simultaneous EV charging
- **Important gap:** 220.84 (multi-family) did NOT get the same amendment, creating code inconsistency

### Continuous Load Treatment

- EVSE is considered continuous load — calculated at 100%, not 40%
- EVSE needs 125% of rated load per NEC 210.19(A)
- Multiple conflicting AHJ interpretations exist

## 10. Customer Acquisition Analysis

### Channel Assessment

| Channel | Cost | Reach | Intent Level |
|---------|------|-------|-------------|

| Reddit r/electricians | Free | 400K+ members | Medium |
| Electrician Talk Forum | Free | Active professionals | High |
| Google Ads (long-tail NEC terms) | $2-5/click | Low competition, high intent | Very High |
| YouTube tutorials | Content cost only | Evergreen traffic | Medium-High |
| NECA trade shows/chapters | $500-2K/event | Direct demo | High |
| Contractor referrals | Revenue share | Organic/trust-based | Very High |

### Unit Economics Estimate

| Metric | Value | Notes |
|--------|-------|-------|
| CAC (organic-first) | $50-150 | Forums, content, SEO |
| CAC (paid) | $200-500 | Google Ads, trade shows |
| LTV ($49/mo, 18-mo retention) | $882 | Conservative retention assumption |
| LTV:CAC ratio (organic) | 6:1 to 18:1 | Healthy is >3:1 |
| LTV:CAC ratio (paid) | 1.8:1 to 4.4:1 | Marginal at low end |

### Infrastructure Costs (at Scale)

| Service | Cost/Month | At 200 Users |
|---------|-----------|-------------|
| Railway Backend | $7-25 | $7-25 |
| Gemini API (with 90% caching) | ~$50 | ~$50 |
| Supabase Pro | $25 | $25 |
| **Total** | **$82-100** | **$82-100** |

**Gross margin at 200 users ($49/mo):** ($9,800 - $100) / $9,800 = **99%**

## 11. Forum Evidence (Key Quotes)

### NEC 220.84 + EVSE Confusion

> "There is a real problem with applying both the 40% demand factor from 220.82 and the demand factors from Table 220.84 to EV chargers: with a 15-unit building and 40A continuous EVSEs in each unit, the optional load calculation only increases by 40% x 40% x 15 x 40A = 96A, but just 3 of those 15 EVSEs drawing full current would actually exceed that level"
> — Mike Holt Forum, EV Charging Calculations thread

> "It confused the heck out of me"
> — Electrician, Mike Holt Forum (on multifamily calculation threads)

> "When I read a code section that sends me to another section that sends me to an exemption and to another code section... I get lost"
> — Mike Holt Forum, NEC 220.84 thread

### Contractors Turning Down Work

> "We've stopped installing multi unit ac's and chargers... We can do it but usually tell them it's $2-10k to calculate the demands... Zero customers have been willing to pay so far."
> — deltasparky, Electrician Talk Forum

> "There is no FEASABLE answer for your problem"
> — Forum response to multi-family EV question (when feasible IS the correct answer with NEC 220.84)

### Plan Reviewer Inconsistency

> Plan reviewers have stated they may not apply diversity factors to EV chargers in multi-family buildings — inconsistent interpretations across jurisdictions
> — Mike Holt Forum, Multi-Family Building with EV Chargers thread

### Engineering Fee Complaints

> $4,500 quoted for surveying existing service to add 4kW load — described as "overblown." Small M/P engineering firm does much larger jobs for cheaper.
> — Mike Holt Forum, Need an Engineer thread

### Outsourcing Practice

> Some electrical contractors "outsource load calculation work to third parties and engineers, sending data for professional calculations"
> — Electrician Talk Forum, residential load calculations thread

## 12. Quantified Opportunity Score

| Criterion | Weight | Score (1-10) | Weighted |
|-----------|--------|--------------|----------|
| Market size | 20% | 7 | 1.40 |
| Pain severity | 20% | 9 | 1.80 |
| Competitive whitespace | 15% | 9 | 1.35 |
| Willingness to pay | 15% | 9 | 1.35 |
| Market timing | 10% | 9 | 0.90 |
| Regulatory tailwinds | 10% | 9 | 0.90 |
| Execution feasibility | 10% | 6 | 0.60 |
| **TOTAL** | **100%** | | **8.30/10** |

**Verdict:** Strong Go. Market gap is real, timing is near-optimal, and no competitor occupies the niche. Primary risk is execution bandwidth, not market viability.
