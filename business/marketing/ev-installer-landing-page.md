## 📊 Problem Section (Above the Fold)

### Headline
**"Every EV charger quote is the same 3-hour headache:"**

### 3-Column Problem Grid

| ⏰ **Slow Quoting** | 💸 **Lost Jobs** | 🔨 **Change Orders** |
|---------------------|------------------|----------------------|
| 2-3 hours to calculate if they need a service upgrade | Over-quote by $3,000 → customer goes with competitor | Under-quote → discover mid-job they need 400A service |
| Drive to job site just to check panel label | Under-quote by $2,000 → eat the loss on change order | Now you're paying for the upgrade out of pocket |
| Customer calls 3 other installers while you're calculating | Customer thinks you don't know what you're doing | Customer angry, threatens 1-star review |

### Transition Statement
**"There's a better way. NEC Pro gives you the answer before you hang up the phone."**

---

## ✅ Solution Section (Benefits-Focused)

### Headline
