**Last Updated:** February 9, 2026
**Review Cadence:** Monthly (see [Document Maintenance](#document-maintenance))
**Status:** Pre-revenue. Product built. Entering go-to-market phase.

---

## Executive Summary

### The Opportunity

Multi-family EV charging is the highest-pain, highest-willingness-to-pay niche in the electrical contracting market. Contractors are turning down $10,000-$50,000 jobs because they cannot produce the NEC 220.84 calculations inspectors require. Engineering firms charge $2-10K per project. No affordable software exists to bridge this gap.

**NEC Pro Compliance** automates these calculations at $49-149/mo — a 40x+ ROI on the first project.

### What We Know vs What We Assume

| Category | Status | Evidence |
|----------|--------|----------|
| Pain exists | **Validated** | Forum posts, contractor quotes, engineering fee data |
| No competitor in this niche | **Validated** | Competitive analysis across all tiers (Feb 2026) |
| Regulatory tailwinds are real | **Validated** | CA 2026 mandate, NY law, 11+ state ZEV standards |
| Product works | **Validated** | Calculator, PDF export, permit integration all functional |
| Contractors will pay for this | **NOT VALIDATED** | Zero paying customers. This is the critical unknown. |
| $49/mo is the right price | **NOT VALIDATED** | Reasonable based on contractor economics, untested |

### The Single Most Important Thing Right Now

**Get the first paying customer.** Everything else — pricing optimization, feature expansion, marketing campaigns — is premature until someone gives us money.

## Market Intelligence

### Market Sizing

#### Total Addressable Market (TAM)

| Dimension | Number | Source |
|-----------|--------|--------|
| US electrical contractor businesses | 251,789 | IBISWorld 2025 |
| US electrical contracting revenue | $237.6B/yr | Arizton 2023 |
| Electrical contractor software market | $1.6B (global) | Verified Market Reports |
| US EV charging infrastructure market | $5.09B, 30.3% CAGR | Grand View Research |
| Multi-family units completed (2024) | 608,000 (38-year high) | NAHB |

**TAM (all US contractors):** 251,789 x $49-149/mo = $148M - $450M ARR

#### Serviceable Addressable Market (SAM)

| Filter | Contractors | Rationale |
|--------|-------------|-----------|
| Do commercial/multi-family work | ~100,000 | ~40% of contractors (NECA profile) |
| Actively doing or pursuing EV work | ~25,000 | EV still emerging but growing fast |
| Willing to pay for calculation software | ~12,500 | 50% FSM adoption rate as proxy |

**SAM:** 12,500 x $49/mo = **$7.35M ARR**

#### Serviceable Obtainable Market (SOM) — Realistic Targets

| Timeframe | Subscribers | MRR | ARR |
|-----------|-------------|-----|-----|
| Year 1 | 200 | $9,800 | $117,600 |
| Year 2 | 1,000 | $49,000 | $588,000 |
| Year 3 | 3,000 | $147,000 | $1,764,000 |

**Reality check:** ServiceTitan has 100,000+ contractors at much higher price points. 1,000-3,000 in a specialized niche is achievable.

### Contractor Demographics

| Metric | Data | Source |
|--------|------|--------|
| 51% of firms have 1-9 employees | Small businesses, tight budgets | NECA 2024 |
| 42% generate under $1M revenue | Price-sensitive buyers | NECA 2024 |
| Average contractor age: 57-61 years | Lower tech comfort, needs simple UX | NECA 2024 |
| 50% use field service management software | Willingness to adopt SaaS tools | Industry surveys |
| Net profit margins: 2-18% | Wide range; tools that save time = margin improvement | Multiple sources |

### Regulatory Tailwinds

| Mandate | Requirement | Timeline |
|---------|-------------|----------|
| **California 2026** | 100% of MF parking spaces EV-ready | Effective now |
| **NY State Law** | Overrides NYC for MF EV requirements | April 2025 (active) |
| **11 states + DC** | Adopted CA ZEV standards | Rolling 2025-2030 |
| **NEC 2026 cycle** | Article 220 renumbered to 120; new EVSE rules | 2026-2029 adoption |

**Key insight:** State mandates are proceeding regardless of federal policy. California alone drives massive demand.

## Competitive Landscape

### The Whitespace

**Nobody occupies the intersection of:**
- NEC 220.84 multi-family demand factors
- NEC 220.57 EVSE load calculation
- NEC 625.42 EVEMS right-sizing
- Permit-ready PDF output
- Cloud-based SaaS at $49-149/mo

### By Tier

#### Enterprise ($3K-$80K/year) — Not competitors; they're our price anchor

| Player | Price | Focus | MF EV? |
|--------|-------|-------|--------|
| ETAP (Schneider) | $3K-$25K/yr | Utilities, large eng. firms | No |
| SKM PowerTools | $2.8K-$22K/yr | Top 40 eng. firms | No |
| EasyPower (Bentley) | Contact sales | Industrial, municipalities | No |

#### Mid-Market ($1.5K-$5K/year) — Tangential

| Player | Price | Focus | MF EV? | Threat |
|--------|-------|-------|--------|--------|
| Trace Software | $1.5K-$4.5K/yr | Engineers (Europe, IEC) | EV module (IEC, not NEC) | Low |
| PowerCalc | Unknown | Engineers, architects | No | Medium |
| IntelliBid | $2.3K-$6K one-time | Estimating | Basic NEC 220 | Low |

#### SMB/Contractor ($0-$1.2K/year) — Our competitive set

| Player | Price | Focus | MF EV? | Threat |
|--------|-------|-------|--------|--------|
| **Kopperfield** | Free (basic) | Residential load calcs | No | **Medium** — closest overlap |
| KalcMate | Unknown | Generic calculations | No | Low |
| Mike Holt tools | $62-$500 | Training/reference | No | Low |

#### EV-Specific Tools — Different problem (operations, not design)

ChargeLab, Ampcontrol, Sitetracker, NREL EVI-X — all focus on charging network management, not NEC load calculations for building electrical systems.

### Threat to Monitor

**Kopperfield** is the most likely competitor to move into this space. They already have free load calcs and permit reports for residential. If they add multi-family EV support, it compresses our moat. Monitor their product updates monthly.

## Customer & Pain Point Validation

### Validated Pain Points (Forum Research, Jan 2026)

| Pain Point | Evidence | Frequency |
|------------|----------|-----------|
| "I don't know how to do EV load calculations" | Master electricians asking basic questions | Very High |
| Contractors turning down profitable work | "We've stopped installing multi unit chargers" | High |
| Multi-family = impossible | "There is no FEASABLE answer for your problem" | High |
| $2-10K engineering quotes | Contractors paying or walking away | Medium |
| Inspection failures | Permits issued, finals fail for missing calcs | Medium |
| NEC 220.84 confusion with EVSE | Mike Holt Forum threads, conflicting interpretations | High |

**Source:** See [market-research/FORUM_RESEARCH_FINDINGS.md](market-research/FORUM_RESEARCH_FINDINGS.md)

### The Hidden Opportunity: NEC 220.84 Demand Factors

Most contractors don't know NEC 220.84 allows massive demand factor reductions:
- 3-5 units: 45% demand factor
- 6-20 units: 38-44%
- 21-62+ units: 23-36%

**Example:** 35-unit building
- Naive calculation: 35 x 100A = 3,500A needed
- NEC 220.84 method: ~1,400A actual demand

**Contractors conclude "impossible" when "feasible" is the correct answer.**

### NEC 220.87: The Measurement Path Differentiator

Two paths for determining existing building demand:

| Method | NEC Reference | Result |
|--------|--------------|--------|
| **Calculation** | 220.87(B) | Conservative (worst-case assumptions) |
| **Measurement** | 220.87(A) | Often shows 30-50% MORE available capacity |

**Example:** Building calculated at 400A demand might only use 180A peak. That's 220A available for EV charging vs 0A using calculation alone. This is the difference between "turn down the job" and "submit the bid."

**No competitor supports the measurement path.** This is our strongest differentiator.

### What Remains UNVALIDATED

| Assumption | Risk | How to Test |
|------------|------|-------------|
| Contractors will pay $49/mo | High | Get 10 paying customers |
| Time savings are 1-2+ hours per project | Medium | Run 10 free calculations, measure |
| Contractors won't just use spreadsheets | Medium | Observe actual tool adoption |
| Permit-ready PDFs are accepted by AHJs | Medium | Submit 5 real permits using our output |
| The "freak out" test passes | High | Would users panic if we shut down for a day? |

## Pricing Strategy

### Current Tiers

| Tier | Price | Target | MF EV Access |
|------|-------|--------|-------------|
| **Free** | $0 | Lead generation | 3 projects, basic calcs |
| **Starter** | $29/mo | Solo residential electricians | No MF EV |
| **Pro** | $49/mo | Active EV contractors | Unlimited MF EV calcs |
| **Business** | $149/mo | High-volume specialists, teams | Everything + PM suite |

### Price Anchoring

| Alternative | Cost | NEC Pro Savings |
|-------------|------|----------------|
| Engineering firm (per project) | $2,000-$10,000 | 40x+ ROI on first project |
| PE stamp (per project) | $150-$1,500 | 3-30x savings per project |
| ETAP/SKM (annual) | $3,000-$25,000 | 5-50x cheaper |
| Turning down the job entirely | $10,000-$50,000 lost revenue | Infinite ROI |

### Realistic Value Analysis

| Scenario | Jobs/mo | Hours saved/mo | Value at $60/hr | 10% capture |
|----------|---------|---------------|-----------------|-------------|
| Conservative | 8 | 3.2 | $192 | $19/mo |
| Realistic | 12 | 9 | $540 | $54/mo |
| Optimistic | 40 | 70 | $4,200 | $420/mo |

**Conclusion:** $49/mo is correctly priced for the average contractor. Don't raise prices before validating. Get 50 users first, then consider a premium tier for high-volume shops ($499/mo with SLA, API, priority support).

### Per-Project Alternative

For occasional multi-family work: $199-499/analysis (vs $2-10K engineering fees). No subscription required.

## Go-to-Market Strategy

### Phase 1: Validate (Now - 30 days)

**Goal:** First 10 users (free), first paying customer.

| Action | Channel | Timeline |
|--------|---------|----------|
| Record demo video (35-unit building scenario) | YouTube, forums | This week |
| Post on Mike Holt Forums with real example | Forum (organic) | This week |
| Offer 10 free calculations to contractors | Forum DMs, Reddit, LinkedIn | Weeks 1-2 |
| Convert most enthusiastic user to $49/mo | Direct outreach | Weeks 3-4 |

### Phase 2: Acquire (Months 2-3)

**Goal:** 50 paying users.

| Action | Channel | Budget |
|--------|---------|--------|
| Google Ads: "NEC 220.84 calculator", "multi-family EV load calculation" | Paid search | $200-500/mo |
| Content: NEC 220.84 tutorials, measurement path explainers | YouTube, blog | Time only |
| Reddit r/electricians presence | Organic | Time only |
| NECA chapter outreach (California focus) | Industry associations | Minimal |

### Phase 3: Scale (Months 4-12)

**Goal:** 200+ paying users, $10K MRR.

Tactics depend on Phase 1-2 learnings. Don't plan this in detail until you've validated.

### California-First Focus

California has the strictest EV-ready mandates (100% of MF parking by 2026) and the highest construction volume (27% of national MF completions). Target California contractors first — the regulatory mandate removes the "do I really need this?" objection.

## Risk Matrix

| Risk | Probability | Impact | Mitigation |
|------|-------------|--------|------------|
| Contractors don't adopt software | Low (30%) | High | Free tier on-ramp, ROI is self-evident |
| Kopperfield adds MF EV calcs | Medium (40%) | Medium | First-mover advantage, NEC depth |
| Enterprise player builds down-market | Low (15%) | High | Speed, UX, niche focus |
| Solo developer bandwidth | **High (60%)** | **High** | **Stop building, start selling** |
| AI commoditizes calculations | Low (20%) | Medium | Permit-ready output + NEC expertise = moat |
| EV mandates rolled back | Very Low (10%) | High | State mandates independent of federal |
| Users churn after 1 project | Medium (35%) | Medium | Expand to full project lifecycle for stickiness |

**Biggest risk:** Execution bandwidth. The market opportunity is validated. The question is whether you can capture it fast enough.

## What NOT to Do

1. **Don't build more features before selling.** After the current branch, the product is complete enough. Every hour coding instead of selling is a delay.
2. **Don't raise prices to $500/mo yet.** Get 50 users at $49/mo first. Premium tiers come after PMF.
3. **Don't pivot to alternative niches** (commercial fleet, solar+storage) before exhausting multi-family EV.
4. **Don't write more strategy docs.** The marginal value of more analysis is zero. The marginal value of one customer conversation is enormous.
5. **Don't over-optimize the funnel.** A/B testing is irrelevant at 0 users. Just get people in.
