## Video Overview

David Andre, who built one of the largest YouTube channels in AI and scaled his startup Vectal from zero to $155K ARR in 4 months, presents a comprehensive analysis of AI business models for 2026. The video covers the "Fourth Industrial Revolution" driven by deep learning (starting 2010s), evaluates common AI business models against four key criteria, and makes the case for AI-powered software as the optimal business model.

### Speaker Credentials
- Built Vectal startup to $155K ARR with zero web development experience
- Over 99% of code written by AI agents
- Community of 67,000+ users
- Went from $600/month to $100,000+/month in less than 2 years
- Runs one of the largest AI communities in the world
- Previously ran successful faceless YouTube channel ($20-30K/month)
- 3+ years experience in e-commerce/dropshipping

---

## The Four Evaluation Criteria

David evaluates each business model against these four factors:

1. **Time Freedom** (1-10): How much free time will you have?
2. **Recurring Revenue** (1-10): Subscription income vs. constantly hunting new clients
3. **Long-Term Exit** (1-10): Can this company be sold?
4. **Future Proof** (1-10): Will AI replace this business model?
