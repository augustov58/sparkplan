  "title": "4 AI Wealth Loops for 2026: Balance, Speed, Signal, Sweat",
  "transcript_text": "As we speak, AI is creating a new class of millionaires. And it's not just coders or Silicon Valley insiders. It's regular people who know how to think like startup founders. I have served as a CEO, board member, and investor at tech companies worth billions. And here's what most people misunderstand. In 2026, becoming a millionaire with AI is not about thinking in straight lines. It's about building loops that let you outearn and outpace everyone else so your wealth can actually compound. But before we dive into these loops, you need to know the world that will create your 7-figure net worth. There is a massive financial shift happening in the market and our brains aren't ready for it. There are two things human brains are never able to grasp. One is exponential growth and second is self-improving systems. Now they're both interconnected but in 2026 the entire economy will migrate to these two ideas simultaneously. Chat GPT reached 100 million users in 60 days and it was faster than any app in the history of tech. And then came Sora 2, OpenAI's video tool and it got to 1 million downloads faster than Chat GPT. And it's not just tools. It's happening to AI companies. Startups like Cursor and Perplexity are reaching $100 million in revenue in 12 to 18 months. The world we live in is all about fast feedback loops and they're showing up everywhere. In coding, in capital, in career, in companies. This is how the best builders are thinking in 2026. Not in sequential timelines, but in self-reinforcing loops. The winners in 2026 will be the ones building the fastest feedback loops."
