Based on the "Permit Sync" concept from Greg Isenberg's video and the specific pain points shared by industry experts like Electrician U, here is a detailed Micro-SaaS specification tailored specifically for **Electrical Contractors**.

### **Product Name Idea: SparkPermit**

**The Pitch:** A niche automation tool that handles the "clerical nightmare" of electrical permit applications and NEC-compliant load calculations.

---

### **1. The Problem (The "Itch")**

Electrical contractors—especially those in high-growth niches like EV charger installations and solar—face three major bottlenecks:

* **Fragmentation:** Every city has a different PDF form, different submission portal, and different local amendments to the National Electrical Code (NEC) [[08:34](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rtP7_TM6io&t=514)].
* **The Load Calc Bottleneck:** For panel upgrades, inspectors require a "Load Calculation" (Article 220). Contractors often do these manually on scratch paper, which leads to errors and failed inspections.
* **Administrative Burnout:** Solo contractors often do this paperwork at 9:00 PM after a full day of field work, leading to burnout [[14:01](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rtP7_TM6io&t=841)].

### **2. Core Features (The Spec)**

#### **A. The Smart-Fill Permit Engine**

* **Profile Sync:** The contractor enters their Master License and insurance info once.
* **Jurisdiction Mapping:** The app uses the job site address to automatically pull the correct permit PDF for that specific city/county.
* **Auto-Fill:** It pre-populates 80% of the form, leaving only the job-specific details for the contractor to verify.

#### **B. Integrated NEC Load Calculator**

* A simplified interface where the contractor inputs square footage and major appliances.
* **Output:** Generates a professional, NEC-compliant Load Calculation sheet that can be instantly attached as a "Schedule A" to the permit application.

#### **C. The "Inspection Concierge"**

* **Automated Notifications:** Once a permit is issued, the app syncs with the city portal and sends an automated SMS to the homeowner: *"The Inspector is scheduled for Tuesday between 8 AM - 12 PM. Please ensure the panel is accessible."* [[15:02](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rtP7_TM6io&t=902)].
* **Photo Documentation:** Allows the contractor to upload "Rough-in" photos directly to the permit folder for easy reference during disputes with inspectors.

#### **D. NEC Version Tracker**

* The app alerts the contractor if a specific city has moved to **NEC 2023** (which requires new items like exterior emergency disconnects), preventing a "failed" inspection on a technicality [[08:50](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rtP7_TM6io&t=530)].

### **3. The Micro-SaaS Playbook (Execution)**

* **The MVP (48-Hour Version):** Don't build the full software yet. Create a "Permit Concierge" service. The contractor texts you a photo of the panel and the address; you manually fill the PDF and email it back to them for $40.
* **Niche Focus:** Target **EV Charger Installers** first. Their jobs are highly repetitive and the permits are nearly identical every time, making automation easier to build [[09:50](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rtP7_TM6io&t=590)].
* **Monetization:** * **Starter:** $49/mo (Up to 5 permits).
* **Pro:** $149/mo (Unlimited permits + automated homeowner SMS alerts).


* **Distribution:** Build in public on LinkedIn or X by sharing "Permit Horror Stories" and showing how much time SparkPermit saves [[14:53](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rtP7_TM6io&t=893)].

### **4. Why This Wins**

Most general construction software (like Procore) is too expensive and complex for a solo electrical contractor. By focusing strictly on the **permit and load calc**, you solve their most acute "itch" without the bloat.
